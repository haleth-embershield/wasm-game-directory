I think your approach is on the right track, but I can suggest some improvements to make it more maintainable and efficient.

## Container Structure Recommendation

Instead of having a single container doing everything (nginx + zig build + git operations), I'd recommend splitting the responsibilities:

1. **Builder Container**: Handles git operations and compilation
2. **Web Server Container**: Nginx to serve the static content

This separation allows you to:
- Run builds without affecting the web server
- Update the web server configuration independently
- Keep the web server container minimal and secure

## Implementation Approach

Here's how I'd structure this:

Now let's create the builder Dockerfile that handles the game compilation:

Now, let's create the build script that manages the game repositories and builds them:



Finally, let's create the Nginx configuration:

## How This Setup Works

1. **Initial Setup**: You create a directory structure like this:
   ```
   project/
   ├── builder/
   │   └── Dockerfile
   ├── build-cache/   # Stores build metadata
   ├── config/
   │   └── nginx.conf
   ├── games/         # Compiled games go here
   ├── repos/         # Cloned repositories
   ├── www/           # Additional static files
   ├── build-games.sh
   └── docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Builder Container**:
   - Runs on a schedule (every hour by default)
   - Clones/pulls all game repositories
   - Builds games that have changed
   - Only rebuilds when Git commits have changed
   - Generates an index.html with all available games

3. **Web Server Container**:
   - Serves static files from the games directory
   - Configured for optimal WASM delivery
   - Uses proper caching headers

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Building and serving are separate processes
2. **Efficient Rebuilds**: Only rebuilds when repositories change
3. **Easy to Add Games**: Just update the GAME_REPOS environment variable
4. **Persistent Storage**: Game repositories and builds are stored in volumes
5. **Clean Web Server**: No build tools in the web server container
6. **Responsive UI**: The games grid is mobile-friendly

## Additional Considerations

1. **Security**: You might want to add authentication to the builder container if your repositories are private
2. **Build Frequency**: Adjust the sleep timer in the builder container based on how often you update games
3. **Monitoring**: You could add logging to track builds and errors

This approach should give you a lightweight, maintainable solution for your WASM game hosting needs. The web server container is particularly lightweight since it only serves static files, and the builder container only runs when needed.
