Your approach is solid and lightweight, but it can be refined for simplicity, maintainability, and efficiency. Here's a breakdown and recommendations:

### Evaluation of Your Approach
- **Pros:**
  - Static `.wasm` files keep serving lightweight.
  - Building games on container start ensures freshness.
  - Cleaning up temp repos keeps the container small.
  - Nginx for serving static files is efficient.
  - Traefik integration works well for routing.

- **Cons:**
  - Building all games on container start can slow down deployment if many games exist or builds fail.
  - No caching mechanism for unchanged repos—unnecessary rebuilds.
  - No error handling if a `git pull` or `zig build` fails for one game.
  - Keeping repos in the container (if you choose to) bloats the image over time.

### Recommendations
1. **Stick with a Single Nginx + Zig Container:**
   - Use a minimal base image like `nginx:alpine` (small footprint).
   - Install Zig in the image for building games.
   - Avoid multi-container complexity since this is a home server setup.

2. **Refine the Build Process:**
   - Instead of rebuilding all games on container start, use a script that:
     - Checks the git commit hash of each repo against a stored hash (e.g., in a file `/games/$repo_name.hash`).
     - Only pulls and rebuilds if the hash differs.
     - Stores the new hash after a successful build.
   - If a build fails, log the error but continue with other games to avoid breaking the whole setup.

3. **Directory Structure:**
   - Keep `/games/$repo_name` for final static assets (`.wasm`, `index.html`, etc.).
   - Use `/tmp/$repo_name` for cloning/building, and delete after copying to `/games/$repo_name`.
   - Don’t keep the repos long-term—disk space matters more than re-cloning (GitHub clones are fast).

4. **Homepage Generation:**
   - Write a simple script (bash or Node.js) that scans `/games/` for subdirectories and generates `index.html` dynamically on container start.
   - Serve this `index.html` from `/usr/share/nginx/html/` (default Nginx root).

5. **Container Size and Cleanup:**
   - Deleting temp repos is the right call—don’t keep them.
   - Use multi-stage builds if you want to separate build tools (Zig) from the final Nginx image, but for a home server, a single image with Zig installed is fine.

6. **Alternative Approach (if Scaling):**
   - If the number of games grows (e.g., 50+), consider prebuilding `.wasm` files in a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) and storing artifacts in a registry (like GitHub Packages).
   - The container then downloads prebuilt `/dist` folders instead of building locally. Reduces container complexity but requires CI setup.

7. **Docker Compose + Traefik:**
   - Your Traefik setup is fine. Add labels to the service for routing:
     ```yaml
     services:
       games:
         image: my-games:latest
         build: .
         labels:
           - "traefik.http.routers.games.rule=Host(`games.mydomain.com`)"
           - "traefik.http.routers.games.entrypoints=web"
         volumes:
           - ./games:/games  # Optional: persist games between restarts
     ```

8. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Add logging to the build script (e.g., output to `/var/log/build.log`).
   - Ensure Nginx doesn’t crash if a game’s `/dist` is missing—fallback to a “Game unavailable” page.

### Lightweight and Simple?
Yes, your approach is simple and lightweight enough for a home server. With the tweaks above (caching via hashes, robust error handling), it’s production-ready for personal use. Don’t overcomplicate with multiple containers or orchestration unless you scale significantly.

### Final Thoughts
- Don’t keep repos in the container—just clone, build, copy, delete.
- Add a hash-based check to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
- Dynamically generate the homepage based on `/games/` subdirs.
- Stick with a single Nginx + Zig image for now.

This keeps the setup lean while allowing for future growth. If you want a sample Dockerfile or script, I can provide one.
